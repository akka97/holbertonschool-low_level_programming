# C- Singly linked lists

## A singly linked list is a data structure in which each element (node) has two parts: a data field to store the element value, and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node is called the head of the list, and the last node has a null pointer.

* A function that prints all the elements of a list_t list. [Print list](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/singly_linked_lists/0-print_list.c)

* A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list. [List length](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/singly_linked_lists/1-list_len.c)

* A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list. [Add node](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/singly_linked_lists/2-add_node.c)

* A function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list. [Add note at the end](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/singly_linked_lists/3-add_node_end.c)

* A function that frees a list_t list. [Free list](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/singly_linked_lists/4-free_list.c)
